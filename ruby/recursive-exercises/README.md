# Recursive practice

Exercises from theodinproject.com

Three exercises from the odin project which focuses on helping us grasp recursive design. 

The first two exercises were asking us to create a method which gives us a set of numbers up to the nth position in the fibonacci sequence. The first method did not use a recursive design, while the second method did.

The third method took a bit of time and research as we were supposed to create a merge sort algorithm. At first, I kept running into a stack error (stack level too deep) so I had to lessen the amount of recursion. Though the concept can be difficult to comprehend (if concentrating on what everything does and trying to keep track), I enjoyed learning about recursion and I hope to incorporate the design when I can. 

Additionally, I learned that recursion is not always the best approach to solve a problem. While there are possible memory and performance issues, I believe the divide/conquer design is an incredibly useful concept and I hope to practice that more in the future.
